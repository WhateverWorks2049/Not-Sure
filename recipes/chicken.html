            This entree is easy and delicious! It's one of my favorites! Try to use the largest chicken breasts you can find so you'll be able to roll them easier

            Ingredients
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>6 slices Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>4 slices cooked ham</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 7x11-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Pound chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle each piece of chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Place 1 Swiss cheese slice and 1 ham slice on top of each breast. Roll up each breast, and secure with a toothpick. Place in the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle chicken evenly with bread crumbs.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                Remove from the oven, and place 1/2 Swiss cheese slice on top of each breast. Return to the oven until cheese has melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove toothpicks and serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
